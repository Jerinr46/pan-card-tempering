# pan-card-tempering
The "Pan Card Tampering Flask App" is a web application designed to detect and prevent tampering or forgery of Indian Permanent Account Number (PAN) cards, a vital identification document. This application allows users to upload images of PAN cards, and it employs image processing and machine learning techniques to check for signs of tampering or unauthorized alterations. It serves as a valuable tool for individuals and organizations to verify the authenticity of PAN cards, enhancing document security and fraud prevention.

Tools Used:

Flask: Flask is used as the web framework to develop the user interface and handle HTTP requests and responses.

Python: The primary programming language for implementing the application's logic and image processing.

OpenCV: OpenCV is employed for image processing and manipulation, allowing the detection of alterations, watermarks, and other anomalies in the PAN card images.

Machine Learning: Machine learning algorithms, possibly based on libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow, are utilized to identify suspicious patterns in the PAN card images.

HTML/CSS: For creating the user interface and rendering the web pages where users can upload and view PAN card images.

JavaScript: Used to enhance the user experience and provide interactive features on the web application.

Image Processing Libraries: Libraries such as PIL (Python Imaging Library) may be used for additional image processing tasks.

Deployment Platforms: The app can be hosted on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or other cloud providers to make it accessible online.

Version Control: Tools like Git and GitHub may be used for version control and collaboration with other developers.

Databases: Databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite) can be used for storing uploaded PAN card images and related information.

This Flask app combines web development, image processing, and machine learning to create a practical solution for addressing the issue of PAN card tampering and enhancing document security.
